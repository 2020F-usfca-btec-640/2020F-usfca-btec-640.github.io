Coding is hard.

Especially when you're just starting out. It can daunt you when there sits a blinking, unmoving cursor staring at you as the error messages pile up. Making progress is tough, however many resources exist on the internet to help you. This post covers some tips for evaluating your problems and a couple of sites you can refer to for assistance.

# Before Asking for Help

## Before You Start

It helps to create a plan for what you hope to code before you actually code it. This simply involves writing out your code on paper instead of on the computer. Doing this helps you think through your process and lets you see what the entire project requires for completion.  

## Problem Arose

It is tempting to immediately start frenetically googling for your salvation. The results found will often not help you or even be useful. Asking the correct questions make all the difference when seeking answers.

But first, you should take a small break. Go on a walk, eat a snack or watch a small video just to clear your mind. Fresh eyes can evaluate the problem easier than when you are frustrated. Ideally this would lead you to the answer right away but in case that it still eludes you, this can at least let you see the problem more clearly.

One thing that helps here as well is if you commented on your code. Writing what your code does  with the "#" character will help you and anyone else looking at your code. Especially if your small break becomes a long one. Forgetting what you were doing will only make it harder.
