Hello! This blog post will walk you through the basic steps on how to set up and
use Atom. Atom is an awesome and free text editing tool that allows you to write in
Markdown and convert it into an html file.
# Setting up Atom
First, let's start by installing Atom onto your computer:
 1. Visit the [Atom website](https://atom.io/)
 2. Click **Download** and install
 3. You will get a bunch of welcome screens, but you can simply close them
 4. Next, you will click **File** and then **New File**
 5. If you do not want your lines going across the whole screen, you can click
   **View** and then **Toggle Soft Wrap**
 6. Now you are ready to start typing!

### Downloading Packages
Our next step will be to download the necessary packages before we can get started on learning how to write cool syntax.

You will only need to download three:
* language-markdown
* markdown-writer
* markdown-preview

To install any package,
1. Open the Package Manager
2. Open settings
3. Click **Install** (on OS X) or **Open** (on Windows)
4. Search for the package you want to download ("Markdown") into the search box
5. Choose the package you want and then click **Install**

# Writing in Atom
Here, I will walk you through how to create
and open a new file and become familiar with syntax tips and tricks.

To start, open Atom and create a new file. Save the file as FILENAME.md, where
FILENAME is whatever you would like to name the file. The .md extension tells
Atom that this is a Markdown file. This will allow Atom to apply the right packages and syntax highlighting.

## Toggle preview
To view how your markdown file will appear as an HTML, you can use **Toggle preview** to split the screen. You can do this at the very beginning of your writing process to make sure it is appearing exactly how you want.  

To get there, go to Packages >> Markdown Preview >> Toggle Preview  
## Converting Markdown to HTML
Our last step will be to convert your masterpiece into an HTML link.
1. Make sure you have your Toggle markdown preview open using the previous steps
2. Right-click in any *blank* area of the preview
3. Click Copy (or Save depending on what you desire) As HTML
4. Paste the result wherever you need it
