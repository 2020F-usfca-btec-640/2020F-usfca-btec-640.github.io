Tmux is an essential program for working with remote servers over SSH. SSH will drop the connection if a person's network fails or if they don't interact with the window for an extended period of time. This is significant because anything the person was running will stop, regardless if it is done or not. So, in order to avoid this mess, a person must "hand off" the work to tmux. The program will allow the process to continue even after they disconnect, whether it be on purpose or on accident.

**Tmux interface: on the command line, plain text**


## Think About It This Way
Let's say a student and their team must complete a presentation in two days, but this student has to leave and cannot access the slides after the first day. In order to complete the task on time, they must use a program such as Google Slides. This will allow the student to hand off the presentation to another person who can complete the task while they are away.

*Tmux â‰ˆ Google Slides + the team who will complete the task*


## How To Create And Connect To Tmux

### 1) Start a new session using the following command.
You can name your tmux session anything you would like. This example tmux session has been named "introduction-tmux".

*Note: You can have many tmux sessions running at the same time! The work is saved and stays the same when you leave a particular session*

The following pane with a green bar at the bottom will appear on the screen. This means that you are now working within the tmux session.

*The green line at the bottom of the screen tells the user they are in a tmux session (includes name of file and what is running, in this case bash)*

### 2) You can split the screen horizontally and vertically

__Vertical Split__ (Control-b and %)

__Horizontal Split__ (Control-b and ")

### 3) Example: You can run something, detach, and it will continue running until it is complete

__Run Bash Script__
This example is a simple script that will list the numbers 1 through 50 but will pause 4 seconds before listing the next number.

You can see that the numbers are being displayed in order.

*Note: Even if you detach, this will continue to run until all 50 numbers have been displayed*

__Detach__
Use: Control-b and d; to exit the tmux session

You will exit the session and see the message below.
![tmux exit session screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/tmux-07.jpg)

You can check what sessions are running with `tmux ls`
![tmux ls screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/tmux-08.jpg)

__Reconnect__
Use...
![Back to tmux session screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/tmux-09.jpg)

As you can see below the session kept running and finished the loop

### 4) Use `exit` to leave the tmux session

Once you exit, the session should no longer be listed

*Note: The files in tmux are the same as the ones outside of tmux. tmux is just a middle man!*
