### Brief history of programming languages

## Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine

The Analytical Engine is one of the most successful achievements of Charles Babbage. It incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, integrated memory and control flow. In 1840, Babbage gave a seminar at the University of Turin about the invention. Then, Italian engineer, Luigi Menabrea, translated the lecture into French and it was further published in the Bibliotheque universelle de Geneve in 1842. Ada Lovelace then translated the paper into English. Additionally, she included her own alphabetically labelled notes to the translation. In the last note, she included a description of an algorithm for the Analytical Engine that would compute Bernoulli numbers. Lovelace's algorithm is considered to be the first algorithm that would be specifically tailored to be implemented on a computer. Even though the engine was never completed due to lack of funding and a conflict between Babbage and his chief engineer, Ada Lovelace is often cited as the first computer programmer.

## Assembly languages

Assembly language is any low level programming language which is specifically designed for a particular computer architecture. It simplifies the language of machine code and the instructions are needed to tell the computer what to do. On the contrary, high level programming languages are portable across multiple systems.
Maurice Wilkes and his team at University of Cambridge constructed one of the first electronic digital stored-program computer - the The Electronic delay storage automatic calculator in 1949. The machine was capable of adding, subtracting, multiplying-and-adding, AND-and-adding, shifting left, arithmetic right shifting, printing characters and a few more but no division was possible. The instructions were held in a 18 bit format, the topmost bit could not be used due to timing issues, therefore only 17 bits were available.

## Autocode

Alick Glennie develped Autocode at the University of Manchester in the early 1950s, which is believed to be the first compiled programming language, which means that it can be translated directly into machine code using complier - a program primarily used for translation of high-level language to a lower level in order to create an executable program.

## Fortran

In 1954 Fortran (which stands for Formula Translation) was created by John Backus. It was the first widely used general purpose programming language that was used for complication mathematical, scientific and statistical work. When introduced, it was met with skepticism because of delays in development and bugs but eventually became known for its efficiency. It is one of the oldest languages still used today for programs that benchmark the world's fastest computers.

## AGOL and COBOL

Created in 1958 and 1959 respecively. Agol stands for Algorithmic Language and was created for scientific use. It is a predecessor of Pascal, C, C++, and Java. COBOL stands for COmmon Business Oriented Language and was created by  Dr. Grace Murray Hopper. It was designed for business and it is still used in ATMs, credit card processing, telephone systems, hospital and government computers, automotive systems, and traffic signals. *Fun fact*: Pieces of COBOL source code were used in Terminator's vision display in the movie "The Terminator".

Late 1960s to late 1970s flourished with programming languages, many of which are still used today.

## BASIC

BASIC, which stands for Beginnerâ€™s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, was developed in 1964 by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz for students to help with understanding computers, even without advanced skillset in mathematics. Bill Gates and Paul Allen modified BASIC and became the first Microsoft product.

## Pascal

Pascal was named after the French mathematician, physicist and philosopher Blaise Pascal. The language was developed in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth and created as a tool for teaching computer programming. In Apple's early years it was used as a main language for their software programming.
