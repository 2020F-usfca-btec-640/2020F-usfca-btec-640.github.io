Title:  Defensive programming - what it is and why it is important  
Author: Gabrielly Lunkes

Often times, a piece of code is used by different people, not only the person who created it. Also, codes can frequently be used to process different types of data. In my opinion, this flexibility to use the same code to process different datasets is one of the greatest things about coding. However, how is it possible to write a code in a way that other programmers would be able navigate through, and even use it with different types of input without spending endless hours trying to figure out how things work? Yes, you guessed it, the answer is in defensive programming.
