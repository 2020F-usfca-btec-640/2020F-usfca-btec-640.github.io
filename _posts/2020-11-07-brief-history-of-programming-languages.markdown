### Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine

The Analytical Engine is one of the most successful achievements of Charles Babbage. It incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, integrated memory and control flow. In 1840, Babbage gave a seminar at the University of Turin about the invention. Then, Italian engineer, Luigi Menabrea, translated the lecture into French and it was further published in the Bibliotheque universelle de Geneve in 1842. Ada Lovelace then translated the paper into English. Additionally, she included her own alphabetically labelled notes to the translation. In the last note, she included a description of an algorithm for the Analytical Engine that would compute Bernoulli numbers. Lovelace's algorithm is considered to be the first algorithm that would be specifically tailored to be implemented on a computer. Even though the engine was never completed due to lack of funding and a conflict between Babbage and his chief engineer, Ada Lovelace is often cited as the first computer programmer.
