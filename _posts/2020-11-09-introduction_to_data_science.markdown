# **Introduction to Data Science, What is it and Why now.**

In this blog you will find helpful answers about what is data science and why
it has become so popular in the last years.

## What is Data Science?

Data science is a set of methodologies used to intake thousands of forms of data
that are available to the public use today, and use them for analysis and to
create meaningful conclusions.

Data is collected **everywhere around**, and can be used with different purposes
such as:  
- *Describe* the current state of things, organizations or a determined process.
- *Diagnose* the cause of determined behaviors.
- *Detect* events that can be described as anomalous or different from what
the normal process is, like irregular credit car purchases.
- *Predict* future events.

## Why is Data Science so popular today?

Everyday around the world data is being collected more than has ever been.
Every transaction that a single person does is connected trough their email
address, to their social media, what they like and dislike, where they have
visited or are looking into visit, and what they can afford or not. All this
information is valuable for companies and governments.

#### What happens after all this data is collected?

After the raw data is collected and put together, is important to do an analysis
to extract valuable information from it. The raw data is important, yes, but the
multiple analysis and conclusions that can be drawn from there are far more
interesting than just having all the data without processing.  

The process of the workflow for data science is:  
1. **Collecting the raw data.**  There are several number of different ways that
Data can be collected.
2. **Cleaning the raw data.** It is important that all the information collected
is processed to eliminate duplicates or find missing data for example.
3. **Analysis, exploration and visualization.** Here the data is analyzed,
which could involve creating graphics to observe trends, or comparing different
sets of data to find answers to an specific questions, or trends in the
population.
4. **Experimentation and use for prediction.** Once the data is analyzed and
information is extracted from it, it can be used to build a system that predicts
future events, like trends in fashion, or music genre that are becoming more
popular, even the development and evolution of sickness and syndromes. All that
insight about the data is important since it can be used for purposes like
preventing wildfires or stopping a disease at a key point to prevent further
adverse events on a patient.

## Aplications of Data Science

Data Science can be applied to many different real life problems.  

Three main areas of Data Science are:  

- ##### Traditional machine learning:

For machine learning is important to have a well-defined question, a set of
example data that will provide enough information to build an algorithm
and a new set of data to use an algorithm on.

Machine learning can be used to build algorithms that can help with different
situations like predicting credit card fraud or identity theft, when (in a line
of time) a part of a machine is going to malfunction, among many others uses.

- ##### Internet of Things (IoT):

IoT refers to gadgets that are not computers but are able to collect and
transfer data, so they are combined with Data Science. Some of these gadgets
can be a security home system, a smartwatch, the GPS of a car, street cameras,
and so many more, making them a great resource for Data Science.

- ##### Deep learning

Deep learning is a *sub-field* of machine learning. In deep learning there are
multiple layers working with different algorithms called neurons, and all the
neurons are working together to draw important information from the data. Deep
learning needs more data than traditional machine learning models, but it also
learns to build relationships that the traditional model cannot. Deep learning
is used in more complex situations, like language learning and differentiation,
identification and classification of images and others.

#### Some extra information:

The workflow of Data Science is generally not fulfilled by one person. Teams
are formed in order to have someone working on different steps of the process
that will allow the implementation of different skills to develop the project.
For example someone who collects data might be proficient in languages like SQL,
Java or Scala, while someone that works with machine learning and deep learning
has to be proficient in languages like Python or R and the machine learning
libraries that are used to create complex algorithms, like TensorFlow.
Other valuable skills are understanding basic statistics, working with simple
spreadsheets to create simple visualizations for people outside the Data
Science scope, and also Business Intelligence tools to create dashboards and
visualizations.
