# Introduction of Common Programming Languages
1. Python

Python is a high-level programming language. It supports a variety of programming paradigms such as functional programming, object-oriented programming and procedural programming. Python is highly extensible, which serves as a feature of adding programmable interfaces to many applications.

Python is an easily understandable and readable language. If you are new to the programming language, Python would be a nice choice. Unlike other languages, it uses whitespace indentation to delimit blocks.
