The goal of this blogpost is to introduce the reader to the powerful tool `ggplot2`
and provide an explanation and scope of the abilities of this tool to create effective
visualizations of experimental data. By reading this post, the reader will be
able to use the parameters laid out and write code of their own. Any set of tabular data can be sorted, analyzed and visualized with `ggplot2`.

## General Format

`ggplot2` has three basic components: the data set, which is best provided in
*.csv* format because it cannot be edited accidentally or intentionally, the
coordinate system with the Cartesian *x*, *y*, and potentially *z*, and finally the *geom*, which is the visual representation of the data on the graph. Examples of `ggplot2` *geoms* are bar plots, box-and-whisker plots, histograms, and even shapes with the right data set! It is also important to include the function `ggsave` to save the output of the code with your choice of format (*png* is recommended here). The following code chunk shows this:

```{r save-plot-with-ggsave}
# Save plot here with your filename
ggsave(plot = nice_plot,
  filename = "output/figures/nice_plot.png")
```
Note that the default for `ggsave` is the last plot you generate, so to prevent
any possible confusion, it is best practice to explicitly name the plot you want
to save as a *png*.

## Building the Plot

The first part of the `ggplot` code will include the following parameters, the
dataset you're working with (preferably a *.csv*), the `aes` (short for aesthetics) that includes your *x* and *y* (also *z* if needed). It will look like this:

```{r plot}
# first step towards making a plot
ggplot(nice_data, aes(x = "dependent value", y = "independent value"))
```
