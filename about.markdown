This website was created for and by the 2020 Fall BTEC 640 Bioinformatics class at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/). The students in the course are graduate students in either the [Professional Science Master's program in Biotechnology](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/biotechnology) or the [MS in Biology program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/biology). Each of the posts is written by one of the students or TAs in the class. The goal is to share tips and tricks and explanations for common programming or computational biology skills that might be useful for novice programmers to know about. 

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and all pages and posted are written in markdown and then rendered to html using [Jekyll][jekyll-organization]. The posts have all been reviewed by at least one other student via a pull request against this site.
